I'm taking inspiration from [12-startups-12-months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/). I have 
never built a business before, so I figure the best way to learn is to just do it a bunch. 

My first attempt was [CaptureBot](https://capturelabs.ai), an AI-powered Slackbot that is conversation 
context aware and can automate things for you in Slack. I'm still working on this particular 
startup, but am also expanding my mind through writing more of my findings and thoughts as I explore.
